# IoT Project

This repository consists of code used for application in my part of final project for Applications for IoT course on my engineering studies. It's an Android application, written mainly in Kotlin (one library is strictly written in Java), which was exchanging infromation with Raspberry Pi microcontroller, with Sense Hat extension, via Flask server. It has ability to input IP adress and port for server, then plot information in form of a table or on a graph. It also has an ability to read and write state of Sense Hat LED matrix. 

All text on screens is in polish because it was a course in polish language.
